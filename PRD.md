Here are the most common types of green tea, based on their origin, processing, and flavor profiles:

1. **Sencha** (Japan): The most popular Japanese green tea, steamed to prevent oxidation, offering a fresh, grassy, and slightly astringent flavor.
2. **Matcha** (Japan): Finely ground powdered green tea, shade-grown, with a vibrant green color and rich, umami taste. Used in tea ceremonies and culinary applications.
3. **Gyokuro** (Japan): A high-grade, shade-grown tea with a sweet, umami flavor and deep green color due to increased chlorophyll from shading.
4. **Dragonwell (Longjing)** (China): A pan-fried tea with flat, sword-shaped leaves, known for its nutty, chestnut-like aroma and smooth, mellow taste.
5. **Jasmine Green Tea** (China): Green tea scented with jasmine flowers, offering a floral, sweet, and aromatic profile.
6. **Bancha** (Japan): A lower-grade tea harvested later in the season, with a coarser texture and milder, slightly earthy flavor compared to Sencha.
7. **Gunpowder** (China): Tightly rolled leaves resembling pellets, producing a bold, slightly smoky flavor with a robust character.
8. **Hojicha** (Japan): Roasted green tea with a toasty, nutty flavor and reddish-brown color, less astringent due to roasting.
9. **Genmaicha** (Japan): Green tea blended with roasted brown rice, giving a nutty, toasty flavor with a popcorn-like aroma.
10. **Anji Bai Cha** (China): A rare green tea with a delicate, sweet, and fresh taste, often mistaken for white tea due to its light leaves.
11. **Mao Feng** (China): A high-quality tea with long, delicate leaves, offering a floral, sweet, and slightly vegetal flavor.
12. **Bi Luo Chun** (China): A delicate tea with tightly curled leaves, known for its fruity, floral notes and smooth texture.

These teas vary due to differences in cultivation, processing (steaming, pan-firing, or roasting), and regional practices, primarily from China and Japan. If you‚Äôd like, I can provide a JSON format for any of these teas following the structure you previously requested!

Black tea, derived from the fully oxidized leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant, is one of the most popular tea categories worldwide. It originated in China but is now produced in many regions, leading to diverse varieties based on origin, processing methods, and blending. While there isn't an exhaustive finite list (as new blends and estate-specific teas emerge), the major types can be grouped into single-origin varieties (named after regions or specific processing), blends, and flavored options. Below is a comprehensive overview compiled from reliable sources, including key characteristics for each.

### Single-Origin Black Teas
These are pure teas from specific regions, often highlighting terroir, altitude, and harvesting methods.

- **Assam**: From northeastern India, known for its robust, malty flavor with hints of sweetness and fruit; full-bodied and brisk, often used as a base for blends. High caffeine content.
- **Ceylon**: From Sri Lanka, offering a wide flavor range from citrusy and bright (high-grown) to robust and full-bodied (low-grown); versatile for iced tea or with milk.
- **Darjeeling**: Grown in India's Himalayan foothills, with a delicate muscatel (grape-like) flavor, floral notes, and light body; varies by flush (harvest season), such as first flush (brisk and citrusy) or second flush (fruity and intense).
- **Dian Hong (Yunnan Black)**: From China's Yunnan province, smooth and malty with caramel or honey undertones; sweet aroma and moderate caffeine.
- **Golden Monkey**: From China's Fujian province, made from golden-tipped buds; flavors of cocoa, honey, malt, and spice, with a sweet, roasted aroma.

White tea is the **least processed of all teas** (just withered and dried, no rolling or oxidation), but it actually has several distinct styles. They can be categorized by **traditional Chinese types**, **new-world styles**, and **flavored/infused whites**. Here‚Äôs a complete breakdown:

---

## üå± Traditional Chinese White Teas

The classic white teas come mainly from **Fujian province** in China:

* **Silver Needle (Baihao Yinzhen, ÁôΩÊØ´Èì∂Èíà)**

  * Made from only young tea buds covered in silvery-white down.
  * Delicate, sweet, light, with notes of melon, cucumber, or honeysuckle.
  * Considered the highest grade of white tea.

* **White Peony (Bai Mudan, ÁôΩÁâ°‰∏π)**

  * Includes both buds and young leaves.
  * Stronger, more robust flavor than Silver Needle‚Äîfloral, fruity, slightly nutty.

* **Tribute Eyebrow (Gong Mei, Ë¥°Áúâ)**

Would you like me to also put together a **parallel chart of black vs. white tea types** (side by side) so you can compare their categories at a glance?

White tea, one of the six major tea categories from the *Camellia sinensis* plant (or occasionally related species like *Camellia taliensis*), is minimally processed‚Äîtypically just withered and dried‚Äîto preserve its delicate, light flavors and high antioxidant content. Originating primarily in China's Fujian province, it's now produced globally, leading to variations based on harvest, processing, and region. While not exhaustive (as new cultivars and blends arise), the main types are grouped below by tradition, origin, and style. I've drawn from expert sources for accuracy, including grades that reflect quality (e.g., based on bud-to-leaf ratio and harvest timing).

### Traditional Chinese White Teas
These are the classic varieties from Fujian, graded from highest to lowest quality, with flavors ranging from subtle and floral to bolder and earthy.

- **Silver Needle (Bai Hao Yin Zhen)**: The premium grade, made solely from plump, unopened buds covered in fine white hairs; harvested early spring from cultivars like Dabai or Shui Xian. Minimal processing (withering and gentle drying) yields a pale yellow brew with light, sweet, herbal notes of juicy fruits like peach or citrus, and a fresh, woody richness. Unique for its elegant, silvery appearance and pure bud composition.
- **White Peony (Bai Mu Dan)**: Second grade, using one bud and one to two young leaves; from similar cultivars, withered and dried without rolling or oxidation. Offers a fuller, more perfumed flavor than Silver Needle‚Äîdelicate floral, slightly nutty, and roasted‚Äîwith a pale green or golden liquor. Affordable and versatile, with a natural, leafy appearance.
- **Tribute Eyebrow (Gong Mei)**: Third grade, from one bud and three to four leaves (often from Qunti cultivars), harvested later; minimal processing results in a bolder, fruity profile resembling oolong, with bronze-to-tawny leaves and potential grassy or roasted notes. Can be loose or compressed into cakes; richer color and stems distinguish it.
- **Long Life Eyebrow / Noble Eyebrow (Shou Mei)**: Lowest traditional grade, using coarser leaves and fewer buds from later harvests (Dabai, Narcissus, or Qunti); withered and dried for a stronger, darker brew with wheat-like, honey-sweet, and slightly roasted flavors. Often compressed; valued for everyday drinking despite lower quality.

### White Teas from Other Regions
As production expands beyond China, these adapt local terroir while maintaining minimal processing, often resulting in unique twists on traditional styles.

- **Moonlight White Tea**: From Yunnan province, China (using Jinggu big white leaf cultivar); withered at night or under moonlight for a clean, refreshing taste with smooth, creamy texture and notes of maple sap, sweet hay, florals, and fruits. Distinct for its nocturnal processing and multi-infusion potential.
- **Darjeeling White Tea**: From India's Darjeeling region; light and minimally processed, yielding an airy, smooth, sweet brew with fluffy, light leaves. High-altitude growth adds subtlety.
- **Ceylon White Tea**: From Sri Lanka (e.g., Galle district); made from long silver buds, offering a light infusion with honey and fruity hints. Rare and elegant, adapting the island's climate.
- **Imperial Himalayan White Tea**: From the Himalayas (India or Nepal); fall-harvested at high altitudes for a strong yet fruity profile. Emphasizes elevation's impact on flavor intensity.
- **Malawi White Tea**: From Africa (Malawi); uniquely uses tea twigs or stems, producing a stronger, slightly grassy taste with honey notes. Represents emerging African production.
- **Other Regional Variants**: Includes productions in Taiwan, Thailand, and northeast India, often mimicking Silver Needle or White Peony styles but with local nuances like lighter body or added floral notes from terroir.

### Variations and Styles
These include processing tweaks, aging, or scenting, expanding beyond pure origins.

- **Fujian New Craft**: A separate grade with an extra processing step (beyond standard withering and drying); light floral and sweet, maintaining pale yellow liquor. Hand-sorted for quality.
- **Aged White Teas**: Stored for years (new: fresh and soy-milk-like; old: mellow with lotus, dried fruit like raisins/prunes, or caramel/chocolate notes); transforms from light to robust, gaining medicinal value after 3‚Äì4 years.
- **Jasmine White Tea**: Traditional scenting with jasmine flowers (removed before packaging); adds floral aroma to a white tea base, light and sweet. An ancient flavoring method.
- **Silvery Tip Pekoe**: A style (also called China White or Fujian White) emphasizing fine, hairy tips; light and pale, sold under grading systems rather than as a distinct type.
- **Compressed White Tea (Cakes)**: Loose teas like Gong Mei, Shou Mei, or White Peony pressed into cakes for storage; no flavor change but aids aging and portability.
- **Camellia Taliensis White Tea**: From Yunnan's wild *Camellia taliensis* plant (not *sinensis*); processed like white tea for a light, pale brew. Unique for its non-standard plant source.

Note: Flavored blends (e.g., mango pear or ginger pear) exist but are not "types" of white tea‚Äîthey're infusions on a white base. White tea generally has low caffeine (due to minimal oxidation) and brews best at 160‚Äì185¬∞F for 1‚Äì3 minutes.



Oolong tea, a traditional Chinese tea from the *Camellia sinensis* plant, is semi-oxidized (typically 10-80%), bridging green and black teas in processing and flavor. Originating in China's Fujian province during the Ming Dynasty, it's now produced mainly in China and Taiwan, with variations influenced by terroir, oxidation level, roasting, and rolling techniques. This results in diverse profiles from floral and creamy to roasted and fruity. While not exhaustive, the main types are grouped below by region and style, drawing from expert sources. Oolongs are often classified by oxidation: light/green/jade (10-30%, fresh and floral), medium/amber (30-60%, balanced), and dark/champagne (60-80%, robust and honeyed). Aged oolongs develop deeper notes over years.

### Fujian Oolong (China)
Fujian, the birthplace of oolong, produces two main sub-categories: Minbei (Northern Fujian, rock teas with mineral "rocky rhyme") and Minnan (Southern Fujian, floral and balled).

#### Minbei (Northern Fujian/Wuyi Rock Teas)

- **Qing Xin (Ruan Zhi)**: Light, floral base for many high-mountain teas.
- **Mao Feng**: Strong fermentation; fruity-honey with tartness.
- **Sijichun (Four Seasons)**: Versatile, sweet and clean.

### Other Variations and Styles
- **Aged Oolong**: Stored and gently fired for years; mellows to caramel, fruit, or chocolate notes.
- **Black Oolong**: Heavily roasted; coffee-like depth.
- **Flavored Oolongs**: Blends like Ginseng (energizing), Osmanthus (floral), or Milk (creamy aroma added).

Note: Emerging productions in Thailand, Vietnam, or India mimic these styles but with local twists. Oolong brews best at 185-205¬∞F for 1-3 minutes, yielding multiple infusions.
